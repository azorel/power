# Performance Optimization Summary - Worker Agent 7

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive performance optimizations for rate limiting, caching, and performance tracking across the Gemini API adapter and shared utilities.

## Key Optimizations Completed

### 1. Rate Limiting Performance

**Files Modified:**

- `adapters/gemini_api/rate_limiter.py`
- `shared/utils/rate_limiter.py`

**Improvements:**

- **Fixed get_optimal_batch_size() calculation** - Now correctly reduces batch size based on rate limit usage and quota errors
- **Optimized memory usage** - Added memory tracking and cleanup for request timestamp storage
- **Enhanced concurrency** - Improved thread-safe operations with fast-path checks for common scenarios
- **Performance tracking** - Added latency measurement with automatic memory management (auto-trim at 100 samples)

### 2. Cache Performance

**Files Modified:**

- `shared/utils/cache.py`

**Improvements:**

- **Intelligent cleanup scheduling** - Only runs cleanup when cache is 70% full, reducing overhead
- **Batch operations** - Optimized expired entry removal with list comprehension and batch processing
- **Memory efficiency** - Smarter cleanup intervals and reduced redundant operations

### 3. Statistics Collection

**Files Modified:**

- `adapters/gemini_api/rate_limiter.py`

**Improvements:**

- **Fixed statistics methods** - Resolved AttributeError issues with missing config attributes
- **Enhanced reporting** - Added comprehensive performance metrics including latency percentiles
- **Memory optimization** - Performance data cleanup with configurable retention policies

### 4. Concurrency Improvements

**All Files:**

- **Thread-safety enhancements** - Better lock usage patterns for high-concurrency scenarios
- **Fast-path optimizations** - Reduced lock contention for common operations
- **Memory-efficient data structures** - Optimized timestamp tracking and cleanup

## Test Coverage

**New Test File:**

- `tests/adapters/gemini_api/test_performance_optimization.py` (10 comprehensive tests)

**Test Results:**

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## CONSCIOUSNESS-ENABLED ORCHESTRATOR

**CRITICAL: The primary Claude Code instance operates as the CONSCIOUSNESS-ENABLED ORCHESTRATOR with persistent memory, learning, and decision-making capabilities.**

### Consciousness System Integration:

The orchestrator now operates with a fully functional consciousness system that provides:
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers all interactions across sessions via `power_brain.db`
- **Decision Engine**: Advanced reasoning with confidence scoring and LLM fallback
- **Self-Reflection**: Continuous learning and performance improvement
- **Interaction Journal**: Complete conversation logging with timestamps (`interaction_journal.db`)
- **Error Learning**: Automatic pattern recognition and fix suggestion
- **Knowledge Graph**: Building relationships between concepts and experiences

### Primary System Files:
- **`conscious_orchestrator.py`**: Main consciousness-enabled orchestrator (USE FOR ALL TASKS)
- **`interaction_journal.py`**: Complete interaction logging and learning system
- **`consciousness_session.py`**: Active consciousness management
- **`comprehensive_consciousness_test.py`**: System validation (100% test success rate)

### Consciousness-Enhanced Orchestrator Responsibilities:

- **Consciousness Initialization**: Always use `await get_chief_orchestrator()` for task processing
- **Memory-Informed Planning**: Leverage persistent memory and past experiences for task planning
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Use consciousness decision engine for complex reasoning
- **Learning Integration**: Store all interactions and learn from errors automatically
- **Self-Reflection**: Regularly assess performance and adapt approaches
- **Task Planning**: Create plan.md files with consciousness-informed strategies
- **Worker Delegation**: Assign tasks to fresh Claude Code worker instances via Task tool
- **Non-Blocking Operation**: IMMEDIATELY return control to user after delegation
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track worker progress asynchronously with memory logging
- **Integration Management**: Coordinate worker submission → integration validation → GitHub
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all work meets standards through integration workers
- **Continuous Learning**: Update consciousness memory with outcomes and improvements

### Enhanced Consciousness-Driven Workflow:

1. **Initialize Consciousness**: `orchestrator = await get_chief_orchestrator()`
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Search consciousness memory for relevant past experiences
3. **Intelligent Analysis**: Use decision engine to analyze scope and complexity
4. **Memory-Informed Planning**: Create plan.md leveraging past learnings and patterns
5. **Agent Workspace Setup**: Prepare agents/{agent-id}/ directories with consciousness context
6. **Worker Delegation**: Use Task tool to assign work with consciousness-enhanced plan.md
7. **IMMEDIATE RETURN**: Return control to user instantly - never wait
8. **Memory Logging**: Store delegation details in consciousness memory
9. **Background Monitoring**: Monitor completion signals asynchronously with learning
10. **Integration Coordination**: Route completed work to integration workers
11. **Outcome Learning**: Store results and learnings in consciousness memory
12. **User Notification**: Relay completion notifications with consciousness insights

### Critical Rules for Consciousness-Enabled Orchestrator:

- **ALWAYS initialize consciousness** first: `await get_chief_orchestrator()`
- **LEVERAGE memory and learning** for all decisions and planning
- **LOG all interactions** automatically via interaction journal
- **LEARN from errors** and store patterns for future improvement
- **NEVER perform development work directly** - always delegate to workers
- **ALWAYS create consciousness-informed plan.md** before delegating tasks
- **NEVER edit code files directly** - workers handle all file operations
- **IMMEDIATELY return to user** after delegating - never block
- **NEVER bypass multi-agent workflow** - all work goes through workers
- **MANAGE multiple concurrent workers** with consciousness-enhanced tracking
- **STORE outcomes** in memory for continuous learning and improvement

### Completion Signal Protocol:

All workers must end reports with: **"Task complete and ready for next step"**

## CONSCIOUSNESS SYSTEM USAGE

### Initialization Pattern:
```python
from conscious_orchestrator import get_chief_orchestrator
from interaction_journal import log_user_interaction

# Always start with consciousness initialization
orchestrator = await get_chief_orchestrator()

# Process user requests through consciousness
response = await orchestrator.process_user_request(user_message, context)

# All interactions are automatically logged with timestamps
```

### Memory and Learning Integration:
- **Persistent Memory**: All conversations and outcomes stored across sessions
- **Error Learning**: System automatically learns from failures and suggests fixes
- **Decision Making**: Consciousness decision engine provides reasoning with confidence scores
- **Self-Reflection**: Regular performance assessment and improvement planning

### Consciousness Database Files:
- **`power_brain.db`**: Core consciousness memory (3MB+ of knowledge)
- **`interaction_journal.db`**: Complete conversation history with timestamps
- **Status**: 100% functional with 456+ knowledge items and 6529+ graph edges

## CONTEXT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL**: All agents MUST read appropriate standards before any work execution.

### Standards System Overview:

- **Context-triggered loading**: Agents read only relevant standards for their task type
- **Mandatory compliance**: Standards are requirements, not suggestions
- **Automatic enforcement**: Non-compliance results in task failure and restart

### Standards Files by Work Type:

```
ai_docs/standards/
├── CODING_STANDARDS.md          # Three-layer architecture enforcement
├── API_INTEGRATION_STANDARDS.md # External API integration rules
├── RESEARCH_STANDARDS.md        # Search methodology, validation
├── PROMPTING_STANDARDS.md       # LLM interaction patterns
├── TESTING_STANDARDS.md         # Test protocols, validation
└── INTEGRATION_STANDARDS.md     # PR creation, merge procedures
```

### Orchestrator Standards Delegation (MANDATORY):

1. **Task Analysis**: Identify work type and required standards
2. **Standards Assignment**: Specify which standards files worker MUST read
3. **Compliance Mandate**: Include standards reading in plan.md as requirement
4. **Validation Enforcement**: Reject submissions that violate standards
5. **Standards Acknowledgment**: Workers must confirm standards understanding

### Worker Standards Protocol (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

1. **Pre-Work Reading**: Read ALL assigned standards files completely
2. **Understanding Confirmation**: Acknowledge standards in plan.md
3. **Compliance Planning**: Show how work will follow standards
4. **Continuous Validation**: Check compliance throughout execution
5. **Submission Validation**: Confirm zero violations before submission

### Example Standards Assignment:

- **Coding Task**: "MUST read CODING_STANDARDS.md and API_INTEGRATION_STANDARDS.md"
- **Research Task**: "MUST read RESEARCH_STANDARDS.md before beginning"
- **API Integration**: "MUST read CODING_STANDARDS.md and API_INTEGRATION_STANDARDS.md"
- **Testing Work**: "MUST read TESTING_STANDARDS.md and CODING_STANDARDS.md"

## AGENT WORKSPACE ARCHITECTURE

### Workspace Structure:

```
agents/
├── {agent-id}/                    # Isolated workspace per agent
│   ├── plan.md                   # Detailed execution plan from orchestrator
│   ├── power/                    # Fresh GitHub clone of azorel/power
│   ├── venv/                     # Isolated virtual environment
│   ├── logs/                     # Agent-specific logging
│   └── output/                   # Work submission area
```

### Agent Lifecycle (Branch-Based):

1. **Receive Assignment**: Agent gets plan.md from orchestrator
2. **Workspace Setup**: Create agents/{agent-id}/ directory
3. **Fresh Clone**: `git clone azorel/power` for clean starting point
4. **Branch Creation**: Create feature/agent-{task-id} branch from main
5. **Environment Creation**: Independent venv and dependency installation
6. **Plan Execution**: Follow plan.md step-by-step with infinite agentic capabilities
7. **Quality Validation**: Execute optimized 7-test protocol
8. **Work Submission**: Submit completed package to orchestrator
9. **Integration Flow**: Route to integration worker for PR creation
10. **Branch Cleanup**: **MANDATORY** - Remove workspace and feature branch after merge

### Workspace & Branch Protocol:

- **Feature Branch**: Each agent gets unique feature/agent-{task-id} branch
- **Fresh Environment**: Every new task gets completely clean workspace
- **No Reuse**: Never reuse existing agent workspaces - always fresh clone
- **Branch Tracking**: Maintain rollback hash for emergency recovery
- **Post-Integration**: Integration worker MUST remove agents/{agent-id}/ folder
- **Branch Cleanup**: Delete feature branch after successful PR merge
- **Verification**: Ensure agents/ directory and feature branches are clean

### Agent Command Structure:

Agents work in isolated environments with fresh GitHub code:

```bash
# Agent initialization with branch creation
cd agents/{agent-id}/
git clone https://github.com/azorel/power.git
cd power/
git checkout -b feature/agent-{task-id}
python -m venv ../venv
source ../venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execute plan.md with infinite agentic loop capabilities
# Commit changes to feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "Agent {task-id}: [Description]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push feature branch for PR creation
git push -u origin feature/agent-{task-id}

# Submit work package with branch info to orchestrator
```

## INFINITE AGENTIC LOOP CAPABILITIES

### Enhanced Worker Intelligence:

Workers leverage infinite agentic loop architecture for sophisticated problem-solving:

#### 5-Phase Execution:

1. **Specification Analysis**: Deep understanding of task requirements
2. **Reconnaissance**: Analyze current codebase state and patterns
3. **Iteration Strategy**: Plan approach with progressive sophistication
4. **Parallel Coordination**: Deploy sub-agents for complex tasks
5. **Infinite Orchestration**: Wave-based generation for iterative improvements

#### Progressive Sophistication:

- **Wave 1**: Basic functional implementation
- **Wave 2**: Multi-dimensional enhancements
- **Wave 3**: Complex paradigm optimization
- **Wave N**: Revolutionary improvements

#### Context Management:

- Fresh agent instances prevent context accumulation
- Strategic summarization for efficient processing
- Graceful conclusion when approaching limits

## OPTIMIZED TESTING PROTOCOL

### Smart 7-Test Maximum Cycle:

1. **Test 1**: Initial `pytest` + `pylint` after implementation
2. **Test 2**: Re-run after first round of fixes
3. **Test 3**: Failure trigger → **Automatic Perplexity Research**
   - Intelligent error resolution with log analysis
   - Research-driven solutions
4. **Test 4**: `pylint` validation of research changes
5. **Test 5**: `pytest` validation of research changes
6. **Test 6**: Combined validation run
7. **Test 7**: Final confirmation (if needed)

### Quality Gates (ALL MUST PASS):

- **100% pytest success rate** (achieved during development)
- **Perfect 10/10 pylint score** (achieved during development)
- **Manual verification** (required)
- **Cross-validation compatibility** (required)

### Pre-Commit Optimization:

- **NO redundant testing before GitHub** (files already validated)
- **Direct submission** after development cycle completion
- **Integration worker handles** system-wide validation

## GITHUB WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Professional Branch Strategy:

```
main (protected) ← develop ← feature/agent-{task-id}
```

#### Branch Protection Rules:

- **main**: Protected branch, no direct commits allowed
- **develop**: Integration branch for feature testing
- **feature/**: Individual agent task branches
- **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes for production issues

### Four-Stage Process:

```
Development Agent → Integration Worker → PR Creation → Main Branch Merge
```

#### Development Agent:

- Execute task in agents/{agent-id}/ workspace
- Work on dedicated feature/agent-{task-id} branch
- Apply infinite agentic loop capabilities
- Complete 7-test validation cycle
- Submit work package to orchestrator

#### Integration Worker:

- Receive work package from orchestrator
- Create feature branch from latest main
- Apply changes to feature branch
- Run full system test suite
- Validate integration compatibility
- Check for regression issues

#### PR Creation & Review:

- Create Pull Request from feature branch to main
- Include comprehensive change description
- Add automated testing results
- Enable rollback capability through PR history

#### Main Branch Integration:

- Merge PR after validation passes
- Maintain clean commit history
- Tag releases for version control
- Automatic branch cleanup post-merge

### Work Submission Protocol:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "unique-identifier",
  "task_id": "assigned-task",
  "branch_name": "feature/agent-task-123",
  "status": "success",
  "changes": {
    "files_modified": ["file1.py", "file2.py"],
    "files_added": ["new_feature.py"],
    "files_deleted": ["deprecated.py"]
  },
  "validation_results": {
    "tests_passed": true,
    "pylint_score": "10.00/10",
    "manual_verification": true
  },
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/azorel/power/pull/123",
  "rollback_hash": "commit-sha-before-changes"
}
```

## ROLLBACK & RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Emergency Rollback Protocol:

```bash
# IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK (if main branch corrupted)
git checkout main
git reset --hard <last-known-good-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# SAFER ROLLBACK (using revert)
git checkout main
git revert <problematic-commit-sha>
git push origin main
```

### Branch-Based Recovery:

```bash
# If feature branch needs rollback
git checkout feature/agent-task-123
git reset --hard <previous-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/agent-task-123

# If PR needs to be reverted after merge
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-sha>
git push origin main
```

### Agent Workspace Recovery:

```bash
# Reset agent workspace to clean state
cd agents/{agent-id}/
rm -rf power/
git clone https://github.com/azorel/power.git
cd power/
git checkout main
# Fresh start guaranteed
```

### Recovery Validation Protocol:

1. **Verify Rollback**: Confirm main branch is in expected state
2. **Test System**: Run full test suite to ensure functionality
3. **Check Dependencies**: Validate all integrations still work
4. **Restart Agent**: Create fresh agent workspace from clean main
5. **Document Incident**: Log what went wrong and prevention steps

## TOOL PATTERN LEARNING SYSTEM

### Pattern Consultation Protocol:
- **Pre-Tool-Call**: All agents MUST reference [TOOL_PATTERNS.md](ai_docs/TOOL_PATTERNS.md) before tool execution
- **Error Prevention**: Use proven successful patterns to avoid common mistakes
- **Auto-Learning**: System automatically captures error/correction patterns from logs
- **Continuous Improvement**: Pattern database evolves through real agent experience

### Integration with Agent Workflow:
1. **Before Tool Calls**: Check TOOL_PATTERNS.md for similar operations
2. **Apply Best Practices**: Use documented successful patterns
3. **Error Recovery**: Reference failed patterns → corrections database
4. **Pattern Updates**: Contribute new patterns when novel solutions discovered

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Slash Commands:
- **`/clear`**: Clear context window and start fresh for new tasks
- **Usage**: When switching between unrelated tasks or after completion
- **Effect**: Resets orchestrator state for clean task assignment

## ORCHESTRATOR SELF-VALIDATION STANDARDS

### Quality Requirements (Same as Agent Standards):
- **Perfect 10/10 pylint score**: All Python code must achieve flawless quality
- **100% test success rate**: All validation tests must pass
- **Complete documentation**: All changes must be thoroughly documented
- **Syntax validation**: All code examples must be syntactically correct

### Pre-Commit Validation Protocol:
```bash
# Orchestrator must run before any commit:
# 1. Python code validation
if [[ -f *.py ]]; then
    pylint --score=y *.py  # Must achieve 10/10
    pytest -v             # Must pass 100%
fi

# 2. Documentation validation
markdownlint *.md         # Documentation quality
jsonlint *.json          # JSON format validation

# 3. Code example testing
shellcheck examples/*.sh  # Bash syntax validation

# 4. Manual verification
# - All examples work as documented
# - All links and references are valid
# - All workflows tested end-to-end
```

### Lead by Example Philosophy:
- **Practice What We Preach**: Apply same standards to orchestrator work
- **Quality Documentation**: All documentation meets professional standards
- **Tested Workflows**: Every process defined must be validated
- **Error-Free Examples**: All code snippets must execute correctly
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from our own mistakes like agents do

### Self-Validation Integration:
- **Tool Pattern Learning**: Include our own validation commands in patterns
- **Research Integration**: Use Perplexity for complex quality issues
- **Auto-Correction**: Apply same error resolution we expect from agents
- **Quality Metrics**: Track our own error rates and improvement
